            02. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>In Bootstrap, a container is a crucial component that provides a responsive fixed-width container for your
            content. The
            purpose of the container is to wrap and center your site's content within a specific layout, helping to
            ensure
            consistent spacing and alignment across various screen sizes</p>
        <ol>
            <p>Bootstrap offers two main types of containers: .container and .container-fluid.</p>
            <li>.container:
                <ul>
                    <li>The .container class creates a responsive fixed-width container. It adjusts its width based on
                        the device's screen size,
                        providing a maximum width for the content.</li>
                    <li>The container has a responsive behavior, changing its width at different breakpoints to maintain
                        an optimal reading and
                        navigation experience.</li>
                    <li>It has a fixed maximum width, and the width may change at different breakpoints (responsive
                        design).</li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="container">
                            <!-- Your content goes here -->
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>.container-fluid:
                <ul>
                    <li>The .container-fluid class creates a full-width container that spans the entire width of the
                        viewport. It does not have
                        a fixed maximum width like the .container class.</li>
                    <li>It is suitable for designs where you want the content to stretch across the entire width of the
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="container-fluid">
                            <!-- Your content goes here -->
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <p>How it works:</p>
            <li>The container uses CSS media queries to adapt its width based on the screen size. Bootstrap employs a
                responsive grid
                system, and the container's width is adjusted at different breakpoints (extra small, small, medium,
                large, and
                extra-large) to create a fluid and responsive layout.</li>
            <li>The container helps ensure that your content is visually appealing and readable on various devices, from
                small mobile
                screens to larger desktop monitors.</li>
            <li>The use of containers aligns with Bootstrap's mobile-first approach, where the default styles are
                designed for mobile
                devices, and additional styles are added for larger screens.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is a simple example of using a Bootstrap container.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In this example, the content is wrapped in a .container class, which provides consistent spacing and alignment
        based on
        the screen size. You can customize the content within the container while leveraging Bootstrap's responsive
        design
        features.</p>
