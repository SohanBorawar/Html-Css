            03. What are the default Bootstrap text settings?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, provides default styles for typography to enhance the appearance of
            text on
            websites. Here are the default Bootstrap text settings:</p>
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Font Family:
            <ul>
                <li>Bootstrap sets the default font family to sans-serif. This provides a clean and modern look.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Font Size:
            <ul>
                <li>The base font size is set to 16px by default.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Font Weight:
            <ul>
                <li>The default font weight is 400 for normal text and 700 for bold text.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Line Height:
            <ul>
                <li>Bootstrap sets the default line height to 1.5 for improved readability and spacing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Text Color:
            <ul>
                <li>The default text color is typically black or a dark shade, providing good contrast against a light
                    background.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Link Color:
            <ul>
                <li>Links are styled with a default color to distinguish them from regular text. Bootstrap often uses a
                    default link color
                    that stands out, such as a shade of blue.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Link Hover Color:
            <ul>
                <li>When you hover over a link, Bootstrap often changes the color to provide visual feedback. This is
                    usually a slightly
                    different shade than the default link color.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Text Alignment:
            <ul>
                <li>The default text alignment is left-aligned. Bootstrap provides utility classes to easily change text
                    alignment if
                    needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Text Transform:
            <ul>
                <li>Bootstrap sets the default text transform to none, meaning that text is displayed in its original
                    capitalization.
                    However, Bootstrap provides utility classes for uppercase and lowercase transformations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>These settings can be customized using Bootstrap's extensive set of utility classes and CSS variables, allowing
        developers to easily adjust the appearance of text in their projects. It's important to note that these defaults
        may
        vary slightly between different versions of Bootstrap, so it's always a good idea to refer to the documentation
        for the
        specific version you are using.</p>
