        <h3>04. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>The Bootstrap Grid System is a powerful and responsive layout system that allows developers to create a
            flexible and
            consistent structure for web pages. It is based on a 12-column layout, and it uses a combination of
            container, row, and
            column classes to organize content. The grid system is designed to be mobile-first, ensuring that web pages
            look good
            and function well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.</p>
        <p>Here are key concepts and components of the Bootstrap Grid System:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Containers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap layout begins with a container. Containers provide a fixed-width container for content
                        and help center it on
                        the page. There are two types of containers: container for responsive fixed-width containers and
                        container-fluid for
                        full-width containers that span the entire viewport.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Rows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Inside a container, you use rows to create horizontal groups of columns. Rows are necessary to
                        contain and clear the
                        columns. Rows are defined using the row class.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Columns:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap divides the layout into 12 columns. Columns are placed inside rows and define how
                        content is distributed
                        horizontally. You can specify the width of a column by using classes such as col-md-6, which
                        means the column takes up
                        six out of the twelve available columns. The md in col-md-6 refers to the medium-sized screens,
                        and Bootstrap provides
                        classes for various screen sizes (xs, sm, md, lg, xl).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Offsetting Columns:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can offset columns using offset classes (offset-md-2). This allows you to create additional
                        space between columns.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Responsive Classes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap's grid system is inherently responsive. You can use responsive classes to control the
                        layout on different
                        screen sizes. For example, you might want a column to take up the full width on a small screen
                        (col-12), but only half
                        the width on larger screens (col-md-6).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Nesting Columns:
                <ul>
                    <li>Columns can be nested within other columns to create more complex layouts. This allows for
                        greater flexibility and
                        control over the structure of the page.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
        This creates a row with three equal-width columns. The layout will adapt to different screen sizes, providing a
        responsive design. The Bootstrap Grid System is a fundamental and widely-used feature of the Bootstrap
        framework, making
        it easier for developers to create consistent and responsive web layouts.
