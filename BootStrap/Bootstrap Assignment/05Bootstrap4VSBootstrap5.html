        <h3>05. What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Bootstrap 4 was the latest stable version. However, I can
            provide
            information based on what was known about Bootstrap 5 up to that point. Keep in mind that developments or
            changes may
            have occurred since then.</p>
        <ol>
            <p>Here are some key differences between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5:</p>
            <li>jQuery Dependency:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 4 relies on jQuery for some of its components and functionalities. Bootstrap 5, on the
                        other hand, has removed
                        this dependency on jQuery, making it a more lightweight framework.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Customization and Utilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 5 introduced a more modular and utility-first approach, allowing developers to choose
                        and include only the
                        components they need. It provides improved customization options, making it easier to build a
                        tailored version of
                        Bootstrap for specific projects.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New Utility Classes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 5 includes new utility classes for spacing and sizing, providing more flexibility in
                        controlling the layout
                        and appearance of elements.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Responsive Font Sizes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 5 introduced a new feature called responsive font sizes. This allows font sizes to
                        scale based on the viewport
                        width, improving the overall responsiveness of text.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dropped IE 10 and 11 Support:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 5 dropped support for Internet Explorer 10 and 11. It is designed to work with modern
                        browsers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Improved Documentation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 5 comes with improved and updated documentation, making it easier for developers to
                        find information and use
                        the framework effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New Components:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 5 introduced new components such as the accordion and offcanvas for creating sidebars
                        and navigation drawers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Updated Colors and Styles:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 5 includes some changes to the default color scheme and styles, providing a more
                        modern and refined look.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's important to note that while Bootstrap 5 brings several enhancements and changes, migrating from
            Bootstrap 4 to
            Bootstrap 5 may require adjustments in your code due to some breaking changes. Always refer to the official
            Bootstrap
            documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information, as developments may have occurred since my
            last update.</p>
