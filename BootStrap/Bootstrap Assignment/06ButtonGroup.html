            06. What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?

    <div>
        <p>A button group in Bootstrap is a set of buttons that are grouped together visually. This grouping can be
            useful for
            styling and organizing related buttons, such as those representing different options within a toolbar or a
            group of
            actions.</p>
        <p>In Bootstrap, you can create a button group using the .btn-group class. Here's an example of a basic button
            group:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic example">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 1</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Button 2</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-success">Button 3</button>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In this example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The "div" element has the class btn-group, which is the container for the button group.</li>
            <li>Each button within the group has the class btn to style it as a Bootstrap button.</li>
            <li>Each button can also have additional classes like btn-primary, btn-secondary, or other Bootstrap
                contextual classes to
                provide different visual styles</li>
            <li>The role="group" and aria-label attributes are included for accessibility purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Button groups can also be used in combination with dropdowns and input elements to create more complex user
            interfaces.
            The Bootstrap documentation provides further details and examples on working with button groups: Bootstrap
            Button Group
            Documentation. If you're using a different version of Bootstrap, be sure to check the documentation for that
            specific
            version.</p>
