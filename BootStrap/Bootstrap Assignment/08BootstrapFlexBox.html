            08. In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>In Bootstrap 4, Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a powerful layout model used for designing flexible and
            responsive page
            layouts. Bootstrap 4 heavily relies on Flexbox to create a grid system that allows for easy alignment and
            distribution
            of space among elements within a container.</p>
        <p>Key features of Flexbox in Bootstrap 4 include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grid System:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 4's grid system is built on top of Flexbox. The display: flex property is applied to
                        the container, and the
                        child elements become flex items. This allows for the creation of responsive and flexible
                        layouts.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Flex Containers and Items:
                <ul>
                    <li>Elements with the class d-flex become flex containers, and their children become flex items.
                        This enables developers to
                        control the layout, alignment, and spacing of items within the container using Flexbox
                        properties.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Flex Utilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 4 provides a set of utility classes for working with Flexbox. These classes include
                        utilities for adjusting
                        container properties (d-flex, d-inline-flex), item alignment and ordering (align-items,
                        align-self, order), and flex
                        direction (flex-row, flex-column, flex-row-reverse, flex-column-reverse).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Justify Content and Align Items:
                <ul>
                    <li>Flexbox in Bootstrap 4 allows developers to easily justify content and align items within a flex
                        container. Utilities
                        like justify-content and align-items can be used to control the horizontal and vertical
                        alignment of items.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Responsive Flex Utilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Flexbox utilities in Bootstrap 4 are responsive, meaning you can apply different Flexbox
                        behavior based on screen size
                        breakpoints. For example, you can use d-md-flex to apply the flex display only on medium-sized
                        screens and larger.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of Flexbox in a Bootstrap 4 container:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-between">
                <div>Item 1</div>
                <div>Item 2</div>
                <div>Item 3</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>In this example, the d-flex class is used to make the container a flex container, and justify-content-between
            is used to
            distribute the child items with space between them. </p>
        <p>Flexbox in Bootstrap 4 simplifies the process of creating responsive and dynamic layouts, providing a cleaner
            and more
            efficient alternative to traditional layout methods like floats and positioning.</p>
