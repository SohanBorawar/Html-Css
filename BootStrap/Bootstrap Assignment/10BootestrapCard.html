            10. What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>A Bootstrap card is a flexible and lightweight container used to display various types of content. Cards in
            Bootstrap
            provide a unified structure for presenting information, such as text, images, links, and buttons, in a
            visually
            appealing way. Cards are responsive and can be easily customized to fit different design needs.</p>
        <p>To create a basic Bootstrap card, you can use the following HTML structure:</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <div class="container mt-4">
            <div class="card">
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" class="card-img-top" alt="Sample Image">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Card Title</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">This is some sample text to demonstrate the content of the card.</p>
                    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Learn More</a>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.5.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In this example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The outer container "div class="card"" represents the card itself.</li>
            <li>"img" is used for the card's image. You can replace the src attribute with the URL of your image.</li>
            <li>Inside the "div class="card-body"", you can include the main content of the card, such as a title "h5",
                text "p",
                and a button "a".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can further customize the appearance of the card by using additional Bootstrap classes or your own
            styles. Bootstrap
            provides a variety of card-related classes for different purposes, such as card-header, card-footer,
            card-subtitle, etc.
