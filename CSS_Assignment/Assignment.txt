Let's go through your questions one by one:

1. Benefits of Using CSS:
   - Separation of Content and Presentation: CSS allows the separation of the structure (HTML) and presentation (styles) of a web page.
   - Consistency: CSS provides a way to maintain consistent styles across multiple pages of a website.
   - Reusability: Styles can be defined once and applied to multiple elements, promoting reusability and easier maintenance.
   - Easy Maintenance: Making changes to the style of a website is easier with CSS, as changes can be applied globally by modifying the style sheet.
   - Faster Page Loading: External stylesheets can be cached by the browser, leading to faster page loading times.

2. Disadvantages of CSS:
   - Browser Compatibility: Different browsers may interpret CSS rules differently, leading to cross-browser compatibility issues.
   - Learning Curve: CSS can be complex, and learning advanced features may take time for beginners.
   - Lack of Security: CSS alone cannot provide security for a website; it's mainly for presentation purposes.
   - Limited Layout Control: CSS, especially in older versions, might have limitations in controlling complex layouts compared to newer layout technologies.

3. Difference between CSS2 and CSS3:
   - CSS3 is the latest version and includes new modules and features not present in CSS2.
   - CSS3 introduces new selectors, properties, and values for more styling options.
   - CSS3 has better support for animations, transitions, and responsive design compared to CSS2.

   - Selectors
   - Properties
   - Values

5. CSS Opacity:
   - CSS opacity property sets the transparency of an element.
   - Values range from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque).

6. Changing Background Color:
   - Use the `background-color` property in CSS, setting it to the desired color.

7. Controlling Image Repetition:
   - Use the `background-repeat` property with values like `repeat`, `no-repeat`, `repeat-x`, or `repeat-y`.

8. Background-Position Property:
   - `background-position` sets the starting position of a background image.

9. Controlling Image Scroll:
   - `background-attachment` property controls whether a background image scrolls with the page or remains fixed.

10. Separating Background and Color:
    - Separating background and color properties allows for more flexibility in styling, especially when dealing with complex designs.

11. Centering Block Elements:
    - To horizontally center a block element, set its left and right margins to "auto."

12. Maintaining CSS Specifications:
    - Stay updated on W3C specifications and browser updates.
    - Regularly check for deprecated features and update code accordingly.

13. CSS in Web Pages:
    - Inline CSS
